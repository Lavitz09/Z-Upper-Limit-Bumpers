# Z-Upper-Limit-Bumpers

For Voron 2.4 extra safety measures

Print in TPU, center hole needs to be punched/drilled out after print.

Install TPU safety Bumpers for max height before Cable Chain tops out

Bumpers should stop the Gantry by holding plastic part holding the belt in place

Im using Panzer Chains and using a spacing of 65mm
Spacing is from the bottom of the top extrusion to the top of the bumpers
