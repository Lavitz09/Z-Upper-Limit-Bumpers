# Z-Upper-Limit-Bumpers

For Voron 2.4

TPU safety Bumpers for max height before Cable Chain tops out

- Print in TPU, center hole needs to be punched/drilled out after print.

- Install with M3 x 12mm SHCS screws



Bumpers should stop the Gantry by holding plastic part clamping the belt in place

Im using Panzer Chains along with a spacing of 60mm

Spacing is from the bottom of the top extrusion to the top of the bumpers
